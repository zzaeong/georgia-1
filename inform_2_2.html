                    or herself, wholly or partly, the necessities of a normal individual and/or<br>
                    social life, as a result of deficiency, either congenital or not, in his<br>

                    <br><br>
                    6. Disabled persons have the right to medical, psychological and functional treatment, including prosthetic and<br>
